2. Design Analysis Report (pdf).
3. Static Domain Model (pdf or png).
4. Static Design Model reflecting your new design and implementation (pdf or png).
5. Dynamic Design Diagram reflecting your new design and implementation (pdf or png).

Domain Model: Very clear associations and attributes, well done. Static design model: Don't include classes that haven't been changed or aren't affected by your design, e.g. Clock. Pay attention to multiplicities; a team can only be up to 3 robots. Dynamic design model: Ensure that you give each diagram a heading and not just captioned - especially where some diagrams are referenced with respect to each other. This needs to be clearer with "sd" notation. Unable to understand the flows without jumping between both submission docs. Report: Slightly too much detail about all of the methods used to make up your algorithms, which can detract from your otherwise excellent discussion of patterns employed. Instead, all the details could just be referenced from your models. Overall, this report clearly demonstrated your process and understanding. Implementation: Successfully implemented and considers all constraints, well done. Code well documented.
